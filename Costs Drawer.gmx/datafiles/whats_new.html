				<h2>What's New in Costs Drawer 2.3.0</h2>
				<a href="https://github.com/DarrenRobertLowe/CostsDrawer/releases/tag/v2.3.0">See release notes for v2.3.0</a>
				<p>This release adds a new feature to the front page so users can add text below the Record number and above the first Plaintiff name.
				You can now change the "Costs of behalf of" between Plaintiff and Defendant (<i>further features are planned for this</i>).
				It also introduces the ability to highlight text, which then allows you to cut or copy the highlighted text.
				Note this feature is still somewhat in development, so might not behave exactly as expected.</p>
				<p>Importantly this version also fixes a number of bugs:</p>
